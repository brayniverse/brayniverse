# A Review of Inclusive Design Patterns

I <i>just</i> finished reading <a href="https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/products/inclusive-design-patterns" target="_blank">Inclusive Design Patterns by Haydon Pickering</a> and want to take a minute to recommend it to whomever is interested.

Inclusive Design Patterns teaches you some important principles for crafting user interfaces/experiences that are accessible to the broadest range of people with varying setups and requirements.

Haydon is a very good writer; he hits the sweet spot between technical and not too technical. He doesn't <em>only</em> tell you the right way to do something, he explains <i>why</i> you should do it by demonstrating different approaches and explaining the pros and cons of each one.

If you want to see some of his writing before buying his book, you can checkout his <a href="https://inclusive-components.design/" target="_blank">Inclusive Components blog</a>, which is a terrific series on building inclusive versions of common user interface patterns.
            
Most of the points raised in Inclusive Design Patterns equate to <i>don't do something bespoke when HTML does it natively</i>.

I really enjoyed the book and feel I have learnt a lot and will hopefully form some good coding habits as a result. Thank you for reading and if you read his book too I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
